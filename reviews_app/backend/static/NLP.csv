Great people and benefits.,"Great company, work culture, people, benefits.","Please keep in mind this review comes from the viewpoint of a Brand Specialist. I can't speak for the software developers, those in other segments outside of the Amazon.com retail business (for example Amazon Prime, Amazon Web Services, or company subsidiaries), or those not in the corporate HQ in Seattle (such as fulfillment center associates).  - Zero work/life balance. Everyone is expected to take their work home. Management pretends to care and tells you to not overwork, but if you don't work weekends you'll get fired. I've received a phone call at 4 AM from work. Insane infringement on your personal life.  - The culture is toxic. On average people quit after just two years. That isn't normal for any company. It's a revolving door. After just one year of employment, half my team was already junior to me. People either quit or get fired. Everyone is afraid of getting fired and discuss it frequently when management isn't around. It's really sad.  - The company is incredibly disorganized, the work day is chaotic. There is an appalling lack of training, people don't know how to do their jobs and are being taught by others who have only been with the company for a grand total of 3 months. The tools you need to do your job are poorly developed and often break down or have limited usefulness, leading to unnecessary low productivity which you are blamed for. Systems are constantly changing and no one knows how to use the new versions - some people like this because they want innovation, but the truth is the company is so large now that you really don't have much freedom to innovate. There is a huge clash between a start-up mentality and a bureaucratic corporate culture.  - Management is poor quality, and downright nasty. Many are not qualified to do their job, lacking proper experience. For instance, some were on a management rotational program that put them in 3 very different roles over 3 short years, while they had no background in any of those functions. It was a joke working under those types because they knew just as much about their job as you did. I witnessed senior managers being brought into the company and being ""trained"" by their reports. Upper level management is completely inhumane - they treat people like machines / slaves / farm animals, despite that many of my peers were incredibly bright and talented people from strong backgrounds and with good educations (Ivy leagues and other Top 25 schools). Management never recognized people for their contributions and hard work, leading to low morale.  In summary, I'd say that the high employee turnover is evidence enough of the lack of work/life balance and the toxic and chaotic work environment perpetuated by bad management. As I mentioned above, after just one year, I was already more senior than half my team. Everyone I had known was gone, and I was training the newcomers. Think about that.","I live in SF so the commute can take between 1.5 hours to 1.75 hours each way on the shuttle - sometimes 2 hours each way on a busy day or rainy day. That means being on the bus for 3-4 hours PER DAY. It's a wired bus though which means you can work on the way to Mountain View. But it can feel brutal.  Your first year or two are really important in terms of your career at Google and they affect how you're viewed, and your ability to be promoted. You should always ask to work on high profile projects. If you don't get them, don't expect to get high ratings or get promoted. Always volunteer for cross functional group work for maximum exposure, and then work hard at those things.  You'll likely work on something that no one will explain to you and it will take you at least a year to be comfortable doing what you're working on, even if you're super quick at learning. No one has time to train you or teach you what you're doing - which is kind of hard.  After two or three years, people you started out with at Google start to get promoted. If you're not one of them, you'll wonder why and how it happened, and that process is somewhat political and not always clear.  It's a big company now. And super political. So don't be naive. Expect some people to be catty, some people to be territorial, and be prepared to be mentally tough. Don't let people see your vulnerableness. It's a Darwinistic culture with a huge dose of 30-something idealism on top which can fool you into thinking that people are easygoing - they're not. They're driven. If you're not driven, you're not going to fit in.  When you start at Google, it seems like peer reviews are super important - they are, but they are the sprinkles on the fro yo. The important thing is that your direct manager knows your work, likes your work and likes you, and then you can get promoted. If your boss doesn't like you, all the positive peer reviews in the world won't help you. Make sure you know what your boss wants, and give it to them. You will have weekly one on ones, and make sure you are addressing your performance at each one, asking if they have questions, how you can improve, can you work on cross functional projects, etc.  It's really hard to find work life balance at Google. The workload is huge. I hardly have time to work out. The commute is brutal. My family sometimes needs more from me and I can't give it. I'm still trying to find the balance. I think I need more down time than most people so I have a hard time being structured every day to fit all the things I want into my day, so a lot of things slip, like working out.","Your experience will vary between teams, but one thing that was consistent (for me, at least) is that most of my time was spent focusing on politics and processes. Though I had the opportunity to work on some popular products, the only way I could ever get my work done (according to expectations) is if I stayed late in the day (most of the time was spent in meetings, dealing with build processes, iterating specs with the team, answering literally hundreds of e-mails a day, helping test team troubleshoot issues) -- unfortunately, a lot of this does not really get accounted in your workload, and in those cases where it does, it's almost impossible to correctly estimate how long those things will take, since it relies on your entire team to work 100% efficiently. I believe work/life balance is actually possible here, but it's only at the expense of getting a positive review. Accountability is important, but most of the time, it felt like I was taking the blame (or being punished for) someone else's poor performance on the team. At the same time, you don't want to point fingers, because it makes you look equally bad. Really the only time I was happy was when I was working late to make everything seem like it was on schedule, or I was on a team with no slackers. Sometimes people would not hold up their end of the workload (say if they were more junior people in their role) and management would expect you to help them do their job, but would not properly account for this in the estimates.  Over time I eventually learned to manage these things better with politics. Yes, people who have worked in corporations already are familiar with this problem, but at Microsoft, the politics are significantly magnified. People are super smart here and are always trying to make their job easier and take advantage of people who are not as politically savvy. Therein lies the true problem. I eventually left Microsoft, since it felt like most of my time (almost 70%) was spent politicking and handling processes. Coupled with a decrease quality in the products (the gradual results of their work environment) and a lot of other, good people leaving the company. Microsoft seemed to be going downhill.  Though Enterprise and Azure have really taken off recently, I don't think it will be enough to compensate for the decline of Windows revenue in the end. Surface was an unfortunate flop, and Windows Phone + Bing are sucking money from the company. Xbox 360 was doing great when I left, but now even Xbox One is looking like a poor performer, which is really concerning for the company as a whole, when you combine these things together. Office and Azure are really the only areas left that see significant potential and though Office 365 has showed promise, its revenue is really not enough to make up for the loss in Office desktop sales that are surely to come with the decline of Windows desktops.  So please be careful. It's no surprise they had layoffs recently. Despite most of them being in the Nokia division (because of the Nokia merger) still a considerable chunk of few people in Redmond (even top performers) were simply laid off because of the group they happened to be in. They were forced to leave or re-interview for a new positions in the company (which really does not work in your favor when many others are also interviewing due to of the lay offs). A similar approach was used in 2009. It was devastating to morale. Coupled with the ""layoffs continuing to happen over the course of the year"" really would not recommend anybody apply to Microsoft at least until late 2015.  The company is undergoing significant changes though to make it self ""more efficient."" But it's too soon to tell what that really means. Some people suspect that this will be the people who exercised their work/life balance, while at the same time, they will like increase the number of foreign workers who are willing to work the really crazy hours.  None of this is encouraging. Luckily, these days there are much better place to work and have a good life balance.  So now is definitely *NOT* the time to consider Microsoft. Look elsewhere and maybe reconsider in late 2015 is my humble recommendation."
amazon,"Work environment, People were nice at amazon, had enough work to work on all the time.","Benefits, Work Environment, Pay, People","The People, Management, and Amazon Company is A Great Place To Work! Also The Benefits Are Great! Also They Are Flexible and Will Work With You If There Is Any Problems.","If you want to work 65 to 90 hours a week, work during weekends, bank holidays and don�t have a life other than your job, then this is your place to work. By the way, they will NOT pay your for those extra hours. If you like an aggressive work environment were your co-workers will be ready to step on you to get recognition and work in the most individualistic place in the work and with less work-life balance then Amazon is your company to work for.  Before thinking to work for this company, check on the internet, do some research on articles and videos of what people think about what is working for Amazon. And don�t think that this is only on the warehouses, actually on the offices and headquarters is way worse. Why? Because in the warehouse at least the time is regulated and you clock-in and clock-out and they will pay you for your extra time. In the office, you will sign a contract for 40 hours, you will get pay for 40 hours and you will work at least 60 hours because of the level of work -oad and push from managers. By the way, do you know that Amazon pay people (have employees, under their payroll) which function is to write positive opinions about Amazon on the social networks? Yes, unbailable but true, so how are you going to thrust any positive opinion?  If you have a family, kids or like to do something else other than work in your life, and you don�t want to be a slave in the XXI century, this is definitely the last company you want to work for. As some employee in the USA mentioned one time, a year in Amazon is like a �dog year� working here for 1 year is equivalent to working for 7 years in any other place.","Worst job. Bonus is whatever. Incentives might seem good...but once your in it you see it's just a way to make it sound better then it actually is. The incentives are horrible. Pay is horrible for what we do. Pretty much do all the hard work to only get a simple thank you while all the higher ups get the bonuses and raises and praise. No opportunities here unless your buddy buddy with management. Hard work gets you no where. You can work hard for 2 years and still be in the same position.  They have a stupid saying there that one part says ""have fun"" there is NO fun here. You'll get yelled at if they see you trying to have fun. So rethink your logic Amazon. Upper management especially the OPS are horrible and a joke. For every one good manager or ops manager there are about 5-8 horrible ones. Which sucks too because the lower horrible managers get hired higher and just become more horrible but with more power. They only higher whoever is kissing their but. Not by hard work.  Manamgmet there does not act like management should. They walk around like they created amazon. Smug and arrogant is who they are there. They treat all the lower level employees like their garbage. Yet were the ones that make them look good. Pay is horrible. We work 10 hours to only receive a 30 min lunch. Not to mention there always on you for even a minute of being late after break. Yet they don't say anything when we have to walk 5 min just to get to the break room. Not to mention we actually have these jail sounds now at our facility. Telling us when our break is and telling us when to walk back (not even give a full 15 min break. By 12 it sounds and you need to walk back.)  You talk to one of your coworkers for a minute and get talked too by upper management. Yet if you ever see them. All they do is talk. BS. And just on there computers. Even here I've heard the OPS in Moval talk about clubs, girls, money, movies, people, ect. Like wth? Saw ops manager throw a ball to the wall for an hour straight. See them just chill in rooms and do nothing. Yet there the ones making more money and salaries. Lazy bums.  We don't get really anything here. You have to kiss the biggest butt and know them just to move up. Hard work gets you no where here. See people sweating and working so hard here. Yet it makes no sense. There is no raise. There is no extra bonus for hard work. Only extra is your just making managemen look good. Which shouldn't be. And let's say you do move up to PA. It's just another job your getting to little to be paid for yet your pretty much doing the managers jobs. Almost every job here is doing someone else's job. Problem solvers do most of the hard work. They are pretty much like supervisors. Yet we get paid and treated like anyone else. All they care is about numbers and volume. They don't care about accuracy. They don't care about efficiency. They'll bleed you dry towards the end of the day. And yell at you to keep working till the end of shift. Yet they don't do anything.  Honestly no pros for this company. It is just a company that pays the bills. Don't look for a career here. There is none. And if you think to just go to HR for all these things. Think again. They don't do anything. They will always favor management over anyone else. So even if your in the right. Don't count for anything. HR there is to scared to say anything. They have an open door policy which is garbage too. They do all this talk about you can always come to them. But not even 300 complaints about a managers or almost whatever it is you have a problem with will get resolved. HR there just like the management are jokes. Almost all them need to get rehired or retrained for a month because most either forgot or never got trained how to actually be management.  Once you start working here. All you will think about is the day you finally quit. It's one of those jobs that will make you day dream to when your finally out of there. Trust me. See the reviews here. And you can see how many places this is happening. Not just here in our warehouse. But everywhere. And if you do notice. Most of the good reviews are upper management. Yes of course their going to post good reviews. They don't do anything but get paid so well for that. I know I'm not alone in all this. A lot of people feel this way. Especially in my building. The building close to us. Don't work here. Or if you do don't plan on sticking around.",Long working hours. Lot of work. No work life balance

These people want to look better to senior leadership/get more hires/justify their roles. - Different experience dependent on what team you're on: Dynamics vary a lot. Often, your boss must be vocal enough or well liked in order for you to succeed (as the person below them) since you have no access to upper leaders. - Poor Management & Leadership: Just really bad in a lot of cases and don't really know what's going on. Lack of product knowledge and it's very obvious. - Promotions are selective: ""Favorites"" will often be easily promoted, when others may deserve it more. There is only a certain # of people who can be promoted every cycle. - At times, feels like a sexist environment for women: Males favored, listened to more, and ""boys club"" mentality at management level. - ""Flat"" organization but very hierarchical: Try to hire smart, experienced people in at the low level, meaning you must do everything on your own and feels like you're alone on an island of 1 without help or anyone to manage/hire in below you. Managers are usually people who have been at Google for a long time, and they are the ones with access to the senior leadership teams. - Hiring: Takes a long time. They say they only hire ""smart people"", however, the company is so big now, that's really impossible... many employees are not as smart or cool as Google advertises. - Unwilling to allow transfers to other offices: If you like Mountain View, great! If you do not like Mountain View, which most people do not, good luck with trying to transfer offices and stay in your current role. Internal transfers are also not as easy as advertised. - Bureaucracy: It's a huge company. Don't expect it to be all roses or feel like a small, fun company. There's a lot going on all the time, and you can easily get lost in the shuffle depending on the above re: managers, team, promotions, etc.","A lot of the cons below are projections of my experience at Google. Do a TON of research on the role you'll be applying for. Find people on LinkedIn. Scour reddit. Learn as much as you possibly can about what you'll be doing to try and prepare for what's to come.  * Your experience at Google will largely depend on your team and/or manager. If you join a bad team and/or a bad manager, you'll be in for a rough 12 months (the minimum amount of time that's usually required to transfer out.)  * ANYTHING you do or create outside of work is owned by Google, regardless of whether you used their resources or not to do it. This could be a HUGE issue for you if you contribute heavily to open-source and/or like to build side projects. Google's People Ops **do** look out for people doing this too.  * The compensation is okay depending on where you're coming from, but salary is practically non-negotiable (stock units are more flexible, though) and might not even be competitive depending on your area. Lots of funded startups and finance shops pay significantly better for the same level of experience. Additionally, compensation doesn't scale relative to growth. One could double their salary or more within the same amount of time it takes to get from mid-range to senior at Google.  * Almost everything that an engineer at Google uses on a daily basis is home-grown and maintained by other Googlers. Much of this tooling is incredibly complicated and takes months to warm up to. This could be a MAJOR brain drain to consider depending on your career path and/or whether you're thinking of staying at Google long-term. (That said, some of the tools were pretty good, though I usually preferred third-party alternatives for many of the others I worked with.)  * Most of the sexy projects that makes Google Google are in Mountain View, and if you really want to take your career at Google seriously, you'll eventually have to move out there. Living costs in the Bay are insane and show no signs of restoring sanity any time soon.  * Despite having all of the infrastructure to support it, remotely working is generally discouraged by most teams. That said, many, MANY meetings are done completely or partially with Hangouts and Google's solution for accessing internal resources from public endpoints is probably the best there is.  * Their interview process is generally terrible. Engineers at Google generally don't like to interview and/or provide feedback, so the interview experience for potential candidates varies wildly across the board. The process also takes a really long time. It took me about four months to get to the offer stage, apparently, that's normal there. (To put this into perspective, I've worked at places that took a week from cold start to signed offer, they can't possibly not be losing talent from these insane delays.)  * I don't remember seeing more people glued to their phone or laptop in a single workplace before coming here. It seems like almost everyone travels while glued to their phone here. It's maddening.  * Most interviews are focused almost entirely on technical merit. This makes it (much) more likely for engineers with strong technical skills but (very) weak social skills to make it through the cracks. If you're more outgoing and ""extroverted,"" this might bother you. (It bothered me to no end.)  * There's lots of exciting work being done at Google, but more exciting work usually means even more operational work. A lot of extremely capable people get slotted into doing that sort of work. Do as much research as you can on your role to give you an idea of what you're getting into.  * Technical merit is placed above all else as an engineer. Because this is a significant determinant in promotion decisions, a lot of people spend a lot of time doing ""complex and impactful"" work at the expense of things like documentation or maintainability. As you might imagine, this leads to a lot of reinvented wheels and deprecation. (It doesn't help that every project seemingly *has* to have a name to it that might or might not have anything to do with the project that describes it.)  * Work-life balance HIGHLY depends on your team. In my experience, people at Google that spent a lot of time working after-hours did so on their own volition (for better or worse). Management never pressured me to work more than I wanted to, in fact, they've had to tell people to ease up!"
